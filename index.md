Howdy, <br/>
Samuel Onoja is my name (can also call me <i>borngraced</i>), I'm a software engineer working on the [AtomicDEX API](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API){:target="\_blank"} and based in Lagos, Nigeria. I began my career using PHP and now generally code in rust, with some Swift and typescript thrown in for good measure.

I enjoy playing video games (such as Genshin Impact, Fifa, and some other adventure games like Assassin Creed), as well as listening to music (I like nightcore music, sedate music and a lot of Christian music and sometimes afrobeat).

Not available for any opening atm, as I still pretty much enjoy working at Komodo ):.
