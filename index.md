Hey there, great to meet you! My name is Samuel Onoja and I'm a software engineer hailing from the bustling metropolis of Lagos, Nigeria. I'm a bit of a coding junkie, always eager to dive into new technologies and push the limits of what's possible. You could say I'm a bit like a superhero, except instead of a cape I have a keyboard and instead of fighting crime I'm fighting bugs in the code. But hey, it's a living!
<br/>
I started my career working with PHP, but these days I'm equally comfortable with rust, typescript and Go. I'm currently building amazing techs at Komodo ([AtomicDEX API](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API){:target="\_blank"}), and I couldn't be more excited about the projects I'm working on.
<br/>
When I'm not busy coding, you'll find me immersed in the world of video games. Whether I'm battling bosses in Genshin Impact or scoring goals in FIFA, I love nothing more than getting lost in a virtual adventure.
<br/>
Music is another big part of my life, and I have a diverse taste that ranges from nightcore and sedate tunes to Christian and afrobeat jams. Nothing beats the feeling of getting lost in a great song and letting the music take over.
<br/>
Although I'm not currently available for job openings, I'm always happy to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts. Whether you want to chat about software engineering, gaming, music, or anything in between, feel free to shoot me a message.
<br/>
Thanks for stopping by, and I can't wait to [hear!](https://mailto:samiodev@icloud.com){:target="\_blank"} from you!
