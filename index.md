Howdy, <br/>
Samuel Onoja is my name, and I'm a software developer based in Lagos, Nigeria. I began my career using PHP and now generally code in rust and typescript, with a little Scala thrown in for good measure.

I enjoy playing video games (such as Genshin Impact, Fifa, and some adventure games like Assassin Creed), as well as listening to music (I like sedate music and lot of christian, gospel music and also perhaps some afrobeats)

I'm currently not looking for any other jobs because I work full-time as a rust software developer at [AtomicDex](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API){:target="\_blank"}, of Komodo Platform.

Would you like to talk? [Send a mail!](https://mail:samiodev@icloud.comI){:target="\_blank"}
