Howdy, <br/>
Samuel Onoja is my name, and I'm a software developer based in Lagos, Nigeria. I began my career using PHP and now generally code in rust and typescript, with a little Scala thrown in for good measure.

I enjoy playing video games (such as Genshin Impact, Fifa, and some adventure games like Assassin Creed), as well as listening to music (I like sedate music and a lot of Christian, gospel music and also perhaps some afrobeat)

I work full-time as a rust software developer at [AtomicDex](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API){:target="\_blank"}, of Komodo Platform.

I'm currently not open for any other position right now.
