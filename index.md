Hey there! I'm Samuel Onoja, a software engineer from Lagos, Nigeria. I love diving into new technologies and tackling coding challenges. Currently, I'm building awesome tech at Komodo. When I'm not coding, I'm gaming or enjoying music—from nightcore to afrobeat. While I'm not open to job opportunities right now, I'm always up for connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts. Shoot me a message—I'd love to chat! Thanks for stopping by, and I can't wait to [hear!](https://mailto:samiodev@icloud.com){:target="\_blank"} from you!
