<p>Have you been here before?</p>

<p>When you are in a desperate situation with nothing to eat and no one to turn to, do you start praying and hoping for something magical or miraculous to happen just so you can have something to eat? If the answer is yes and you already have more than enough to eat, why not consider the people who are now in this situation and praying that something amazing or magical could happen so they can eat!. You could be the magic:) ❤️</p>

<p>So, this is the reason why I pledge 10% of all my monthly incomes to <a href ="https://samuelioronfoundation.org/">Samuel Ioron Foundation</a> a nonprofit organization in my hometown, Benue state with the intention of expanding.</p>
